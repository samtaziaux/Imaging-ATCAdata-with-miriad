This guide aims to simplify ATCA data reduction using MIRIAD, focusing on calibrating observations at 2.1, 5.5, and 9GHz. Beginning with initial calibration is recommended to prepare your data, before moving on to imaging for optimal Stokes I images.

Stay tuned for forthcoming instructions on obtaining polarization and all Stokes parameters.

Happy data reduction!
