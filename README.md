This guide aims to simplify ATCA data reduction using MIRIAD, focusing on calibrating observations at 2.1, 5.5, and 9GHz. Beginning with initial calibration is recommended to prepare your data, before moving on to imaging for optimal Stokes I images. To evaluate the quality of your data, you can utilise "checkpoint plots".

Stay tuned for forthcoming instructions on obtaining polarisation and all Stokes parameters.

Happy data reduction!
